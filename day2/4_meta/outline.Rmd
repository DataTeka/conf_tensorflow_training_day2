## Representation learning

- Unsupervised learning 
- Autoencoders
- Variational autoencoders

##### Demo: Variational autoencoders

- If this is the first time eager execution is used, short intro to eager
- The standard way: Maximize ELBO
- improving on the loss: MMD-VAE


## Interpretability

- Short intro, hinting that all this isn't so uncontroversial
- Interpreting a model vs. explaining model predictions
- Approaches to explanation (permutations, gradient, obfuscation ...)


##### Do it yourself: LIME

##### Do it yourself: Heatmap


## Uncertainty

- Short intro

##### Demo: Dropout uncertainty
