## Representation learning

- Unsupervised learning 
- Autoencoders
- Variational autoencoders

##### Demo: Variational autoencoders

- If this is the first time eager execution is used, short intro to eager
- The standard way: Maximize ELBO
- improving on the loss: MMD-VAE


## Interpretability

- Short intro, pointing out that all this isn't that easy to define really
- Approaches (gradient-based, obfuscation-based ...)

##### Do it yourself: Visualizing what a network learns

##### Do it yourself: LIME




## Uncertainty

- Short intro

##### Demo: Dropout uncertainty
