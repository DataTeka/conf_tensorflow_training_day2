## Eager execution 

All quizzes in this section start from the eager execution notebook.

### Quiz 1

Modify the example ("complete example" at the bottom) to use the `mpg` dataset (available from ggplot2) and predict `cty` from `displ`. Use a random split of 20% for the validation set. Change the model to use the RMSProp optimizer instead of Adam.


```{r quiz1}
quiz(
  question("Which learning rate worked best for you?",
    answer("0.3"),
    answer("0.001"),
    answer("0.02", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```

### Quiz 2

What's the shape of the `gradients` we obtain using `gradients <- tape$gradient(loss, model$variables)`?
`gradients` itself is a list of 4 tensors, what are their respective shapes?

Hint: use any "quick and dirty" way that could give you the information. Would your way work with graph execution, too? In eager, could you get the actual values, too (not just the shapes)?

```{r quiz2}
quiz(
  question("Which are the shapes of the gradient tensors?",
    answer("1 32 , 32 , 32 1 , 1", correct = TRUE),
    answer("1 32 , 32 , 32 1 , 32"),
    answer("32 1, 32, 32, 1")
  )
)
```


## Variational autoencoders

In small groups of 3-4 people, talk about what could be interesting applications of a technique like this.

- Applications that mean to generate "something" are fine, but you would perhaps go for a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) there instead. Anything where the latent space matters?

- Perhaps go beyond generation - anything where it'd help to have such a latent space at your disposal?

## LIME and CAM (Class activation maps)

Here you see LIME (200 superpixels, display threshold = of 0.02) as well as CAM explanations for 3 other images. The heatmaps are for the most probable and the second most probable class, respectively (thus, they match those indicated on the LIME plots).

In small groups of 3-4 people, talk about what makes sense or not to you. What could you vary or explore regarding the techniques used?
