# Dataset

- "Census Income" (a.k.a. "Adult") dataset available at [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://mlr.cs.umass.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income)

- Task is to predict predict binarized salary (< resp. > 50k)

- The dataset has continuous as well as categorical variables

- We will explore 2 ways to combine them

- Notebook to follow along: [heterogeneous_data.Rmd](../notebooks/heterogeneous_data.Rmd)

# Common actions for all 2 approaches 


```{r, eval=FALSE}
# convert target variable to values 0 resp. 1
y_train <- train_data$salary %>% factor() %>% as.numeric() - 1
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# convert character columns to factors
train_data <- train_data %>%
  select(-salary) %>%
  mutate_if(is.character, factor)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Isolate the continuous variables into a new dataset
x_train_continuous <- train_data %>% select_if(is.numeric)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Scale all continuous data and convert to matrix
x_train_continuous <- x_train_continuous %>%
  mutate_all(scale) %>% as.matrix()
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Also isolate categorical data
x_train_categorical <- train_data %>% select_if(is.factor)  
```

# Approach 1: One-hot-encode all categorical variables

In this approach, every categorical variable gets one-hot encoded separately, using `to_categorical`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
c(workclass, education, marital_status, occupation,
  relationship, race, sex, native_country) %<-%
  map(x_train_categorical, compose(to_categorical, as.numeric))
```

Now we can bind all columns (continuous and one-hot-encoded categorical ones) together into a train matrix `x_train_all`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x_train_all <- cbind(
  x_train_continuous, workclass, education, marital_status,
  occupation, relationship, race, sex, native_country)
```

# Approach 1: Model training

Please go ahead and run the model for approach 1.
Note the resulting accuracy on the validation set.

---
# Approach 2: Use embeddings on categorical data

Time for a little excursion...

---
class: inverse, middle, center

# Entity embeddings are all the hype

---
# Most people know embeddings for this

(or something like this)

---
# But not just words or sentences can be embedded...

- relations of all kinds (e.g., in knowledge bases)

# Why representation learning?

- Representation matters<sup>1</sup>
- Good representations make subsequent prediction task easier 
- Make use of abundant unlabeled data (unsupervised pretraining)
- Transfer learning / domain adaptation
- Density estimation
- Object generation


```{r, echo=FALSE, results=FALSE}
c1 <- Citet(bib, key = "Goodfellow-et-al-2016", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))
c2 <- Citet(bib, key = "5538", .opts = list(cite.style = "authoryear"))
```
