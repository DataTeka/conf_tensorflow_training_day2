# Entity embeddings are all the hype

# Most people know embeddings for this

(or something like this)

# But not just words or sentences can be embedded...

- relations of all kinds (e.g., in knowledge bases)

# Dataset

- "Census Income" (a.k.a. "Adult") dataset available at [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://mlr.cs.umass.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income)

- Task is to predict predict binarized salary (< resp. > 50k)

- The dataset has continuous as well as categorical variables

- Notebook to follow along: [heterogeneous_data.Rmd](../notebooks/heterogeneous_data.Rmd)
