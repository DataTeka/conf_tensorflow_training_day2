# Road to object detection

---
# Single-object classification and localization

- Mix of recap (if you've participated in yesterday's workshop) and new topics

- Partly demo, partly exercise

- We'll also look at the dataset and preprocessing required for this session


---
# PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) challenges and datasets

- Challenges (2005-2012) included
 - classification (presence/absence for each object class)
 - object detection (same as above, plus localization)
 - class segmentation
 - "person layout"
 
- We'll use the training set from the [2007 challenge](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/index.html)

- Number of object classes in 2007: 20

- Number of training images:

- We focus on concepts and the how-to, not accuracy

# How do you learn bounding boxes?

- Can be framed as __regression problem__

 - often trained with mean absolute error

- Predict pixel coordinates of box corners (`x_left`, `y_top`, `x_right`, `y_bottom`)

- Relevant metric is __Intersection over Union__ (__IOU__), also known as Jaccard index<sup>1</sup>

# Demo/exercise: Single-object classification and localization

- Notebook: classification_localization.png

- Quiz: 2_objectdetection_quizzes.Rmd



---
# Using entity embeddings to improve accuracy

- Used by the winning team on the Kaggle Rossmann Sales prediction challenge<sup>1</sup>

- Better accuracy compared to one-hot-encoding is not guaranteed

- Probably most effective with _high-dimensional_ data that have a _significant relationship_ to the target variable

# Introduction to multiple-object detection


---
# How do we extend this to detect multiple objects?

- Sliding windows approaches
 - Train network, run sequentially on image patches 
 - May actually run sliding windows synchronously (see _Overfeat_ below)

- Region proposal apporaches (2-step)
 - Step 1: Some algorithm proposes interesting regions
 - Step 2: Another algorithm (a convnet) classifies the regions and refines localization

- Single-shot detectors (YOLO, SSD)
 - Perform detection, classification and localization in one step

# Region proposal approaches

- R-CNN<sup>1</sup>: Uses non-DL algorithm to select interesting regions, then applies CNN to all identified regions sequentially

- Fast R-CNN<sup>2</sup>: Uses non-DL algorithm to select interesting regions, then classifies all regions in one pass

- Faster R-CNN<sup>3</sup>: Uses a convnet for region proposal (_Region proposal network_), then classifies all regions in one pass
